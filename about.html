                    <p>Hi, my name is Guro Christine and im a student at noroff, i recently finished my first year as a frontend.developer and are excited to excell at it! at first i diden't know what a frontend-developer was but after having a talk with an prior neighbor i just had to google it, and it seemed like something i would enjoy wortking with concidering my background from videreg√•ende on the media and communication. I enjoyed learning new things in coding ever since and look forward to learning even more in the future.</p>
